  <h1>THE <br>HISTORY <br>OF <br>‘NOW’</h1>
  <p>by Thomas Moynihan</p>
</div>
  <h2>0—Where is Now?</h2>
  <p>
    Humans are the only creatures to have asked, and begun answering, the question ‘where is now?’.
    That is, how much past was required to produce our living present and how much future might be left ahead, waiting to be produced.
    No matter how fallibly, humans have long sought to gain their bearings in time.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are orienting creatures, after all. We seek to map the world, to better navigate our way through it.<sup>[1]</sup>
    And to orient ourselves within this cosmos we need to seek our location not only in space but also within time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published a book initiating a string of discoveries eventually proving our planet pirouettes around a star, which is one amongst many, within a universe ungraspably large.<sup>[2]</sup>
    This revolution — revealing our position within cosmic space — is celebrated and widely recognised.<sup>[3]</sup>
    Less recognised is the parallel series of scientific breakthroughs that have pinpointed our place within cosmic time.
  </p>
  <p>§</p>
  <p>
    What follows presents the story of how our species gained its bearings in time.
    It is about how, across history, human creatures have come to gauge how large the established past is and how long the future ahead could be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why does this matter? Because time is the sole medium within which actions come to matter, wherein what comes before influences everything that comes thereafter.
    Figuring out how long the influence of our actions might reach is a crucial consideration, altering behaviour in concrete ways.
    If I knew I was dying tomorrow, I probably wouldn’t bother paying rent or maintaining my home today.
    But, believing otherwise, I act accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, we all need to extend this type of reasoning beyond our own fleeting biographies.
    Humanity has become a planetary force, causing climate change and mass extinction.<sup>[4]</sup>
    Decisions and deeds unfolding in our present have the potential to alter the entire future for life on Earth.
    It’s crucial we grapple with how long this prospect might be, so we appreciate what is at stake.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now do not doubt that the Earth is roughly 4.5 billion — or, 4,500,000,000 — years old.
    Today’s experts predict that Earth may remain habitable, and a place where complex life can be doing interesting things, for something on the order of a further 1,500,000,000 years.<sup>[5]</sup>
    Our species, by comparison, has only been around for a measly few hundred thousand — or, 300,000 — years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond that, we know the wider universe is just under 14 billion, or 14,000,000,000, years old.
    According to our best understanding of largescale cosmological processes, it will remain capable of supporting complex life for many trillions of years more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compared to all that’s past, we have only just appeared.
    Relative to all that might yet come, the story of life that is like us — talkative and technological — may have only just begun.
    This is our current sense of the whereabouts of ‘now’: of how much past is behind, required to produce inquiring things like us, and how much future might remain ahead.
  </p>
  <p>
    But answers to the question ‘where is now?’ have been wildly different in the past.
    Our sense of where we find ourselves within time’s wider expanses has changed over time, as our species has learned more about this universe and its workings.
    That is, as our kind has compiled records, cumulated lessons, and conversed with itself as it ages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the generations, the ratio of time behind to time ahead has shifted and warped, sometimes dramatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following is an attempt to map this, to plot how answers to the question ‘where is now?’ have evolved.
    It is the story of how, over the centuries, the estimated age of creation has expanded from 5,000 years to 13,800,000,000 years, whilst the expected future ahead for life has ballooned from a prospect measured in centuries to one meted in strides of trillions of years, and how this has transformed our very sense of who we are and what we might yet achieve…
  </p>

  <h2>1—Scriptural Prophecy</h2>
  <p>
    Many cultures throughout human history have assumed time is eternal.
    This meant asking how much time was behind or ahead was meaningless, as eternity is measureless.
    But with the rise of Christianity — and later Islam — such belief was toppled.
    Conviction in an imminent apocalypse, dictated by divinity, became widespread.
    People presumed they live much nearer the end than the beginning of time.
    It was widely believed there have been several millennia behind, and only a handful of centuries left ahead.
  </p>

  <h2>1.1—Ancient (4000 BC – 0 AD)</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout human history, across continents and cultures, different people have held wildly diverging attitudes to time.
    Some have been expansive, some less so.
    The Aztec and Nahua peoples of Mesoamerica, for example, believed the universe would end tomorrow if they stopped offering blood to the gods.<sup>[6]</sup>
    By contrast, Hindu cosmology measured the lifespan of Brahma, named a Mahākalpa, in spans of 311,040,000,000,000 years.
    But this massive interval was nested in a wider cycle of recurrence, which was expected to repeat.
    Indeed, throughout the ancient world the assumption was often that time was eternal.
    There were, of course, countless conflicting, alternate views.
    But what’s important for understanding the ancient sense of time is that there wasn’t yet sufficient evidence to disqualify hunches that — beyond familiar scales — time unceasingly cycles and everything eternally renews.
  </p>
  <p>
    §
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically speaking, when people have encountered something whose limits they cannot directly see, they have tended — ahead of evidence to the contrary — to assume it simply lacks limits.
    Staggered by size into stupor, we conflate extremely large things with limitless things.
    For most of human history, it proved no different with time, at least beyond tangible spans.
    A millennium ago, it would have been evident human lives have delimited bookends.
    But, based on available evidence, it would have remained underdetermined as to whether or not, beyond this tangible span, things don’t just boundlessly recur and repeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the premodern world, the globe had yet to be fully mapped.
    Accordingly, it was possible to assume that everything chronicled and achieved on one’s own continent had already been achieved — and would thereafter ceaselessly reoccur — in other, uncontacted lands.
    Prior to the compiling and cross-referencing of an archaeological and fossil record spanning all Earth’s continents—that is, not remaining constrained within one landmass—it was impossible to falsify the suspicion that human history never properly begun, nor could thus ever properly end.
    Eternal things cannot die.
    People were liable to assume that the human history had instead simply been going, much in the same way, forever, and would so continue.
    There was not yet evidence to disqualify such an assumption.
  </p>

  <h2>1.2—Medieval (0 AD – 1500)</h2>
  <p>
    Jesus’s crucifixion on Golgotha split history in two.
    For his disciples, at least, it introduced a crisp ‘before’ and ‘after’: absolving all humans of their sins, thus applying everywhere equally, and being incapable of reversal or repetition.
    Previously, there was no universal reference point against which to anchor ‘now’ and determine ‘before’ or ‘after’.
    For believers, this obliterated Aristotle’s doubt as to whether we can truly say we come ‘after’ our ancestors.
    God can only sacrifice himself once, after all.
    If one time was not enough then the objective of the act — of universal salvation, of the saving of the souls of everyone, everywhere — wouldn’t have been fulfilled.
    Divinity, being omnipotent, doesn’t work in half-measures.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the rise of Christianity and later Islam during the Medieval period, Hellenistic belief in eternity was toppled.
    It was replaced with teaching that there is a universal direction to time, applying everywhere, equally, arcing from Genesis to Judgement Day.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new doctrine proclaimed that all worldly things had a beginning and will have an end.
    But this didn’t inculcate a sense of a spacious future ahead.
    This was because the Abrahamic religions taught that the apocalypse — whose date was predetermined by divinity itself — was imminent.
    Jesus himself said to his disciples that they would be the last generation.<sup>[13]</sup>
    When, six hundred years later, writers in Judea started to speak of yet another prophet — raising armies in the east and spreading a new creed — his message was similarly apocalyptic.<sup>[14]</sup>
    That prophet was called Muhammad.
    His early followers, like those of Jesus, believed the world only had paltry time left.
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, across Eastern and Western Europe, belief spread that history was much nearer its end than its beginning.
    Each generation assumed it might be the last.
    The average person, throughout the medieval period, believed their ‘now’ was closer to time’s conclusion than its dawn.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most believers, during the Middle Ages, actively wanted the end to come.
    It would liberate them, they believed, of their Earthly suffering and consecrate the final sorting of Good from Evil.
    Existence was considered irredeemably alloyed with sin; the only way to purify it was to end it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, it became a matter of scholarly and mass interest to predict when the world might terminate.
    Theologians used scripture to attempt to calculate creation’s chronology and ascertain its ambit.
    Church fathers and theologians, from Theophilus and Hippolytus to Bede, converged on the conclusion that the Earth was several thousand years old, and there would only be a few centuries ahead at most before creation met its end.<sup>[15]</sup>
  </p>

  <h2>1.3—Early Modern (1500-1700)</h2>
  <p>
    Such conviction, that the end was always near, continued throughout the Renaissance, persisting well into the Early Modern period.
    Methods for measuring the bookends of time remained scriptural.
    Around 1650, the Irish theologian James Ussher famously calculated the world was created on 4004 BC and would end in around 2000 AD.
    He arrived at this conclusion, in part, by counting the chains of “begats” in the Old Testament: a way of tracing how many generations had passed since Adam.<sup>[18]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    It remained orthodox to assume the world was around five or six thousand years old, and would last a further several centuries.
    This sense, of living nearer to history’s culmination than its beginning, affected how people saw their world.
    Writing in 1658, Sir Thomas Browne perfectly captured this overriding sentiment. “’Tis too late to be ambitious”, he declared:
  </p>
  <p>
    “The great mutations of the world are acted, or time may be too short for our designes. […] We whose generations are ordained in this setting part of time, [are] necessitated to eye the remaining particle of futurity, [and] cannot excusably [anticipate any future] duration, which maketh pyramids pillars of snow, and all that’s past a moment.”<sup>[19]</sup>
  </p>
[Position 1]

  <h2>2—Geology & Archeology</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout the 1700s, people began looking beyond scripture to understand the past and future.
    Geology began maturing as a science, relying on the testimony of rocks — rather than the Bible — to gauge the age of the Earth and the procession of its creatures.
    No fossil humans could be found in the eldest strata, implying that humans are a recent addition to an ancient Earth.
    Results from the first experiments attempting to pinpoint the placement of ‘now’ imply the Earth is several tens of thousands of years old and might remain habitable for a similar interval of time.
  </p>

  <h2>2.1—Enlightenment (1700-1800)</h2>
  <p>
    The 1600s saw the advent of modern, empirical science, culminating in the undeniable success of Isaac Newton’s application of its methodology to the study of the heavens.
    Following this, as the 1700s opened, naturalists began looking to the physical Earth itself, rather than to the Bible, to answer the question of where the present was located in time.
    They began turning to the testimony of the rocks, rather than of scripture.
    The geological study of the Earth, as a physical whole planet, had begun consolidating.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1763, the Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov appended an essay entitled “On the Strata of the Earth” to a voluminous textbook on mining.
    In it, he referenced the prior attempts of “Christian chronologists”, before hinting that the testimony of the Earth itself must trump that of the Bible.
    After all, our planet, Lomonosov explained, is the “most senior Chronicler of all”.
    Lomonosov concluded the Earth “appears to be greater” than previous calculations had indicated.<sup>[21]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Having put the question to the rocks, it wasn’t long before scientists were widely accepting the Earth had been around for leagues longer than was previously expected.
    Thousands of year estimates swelled into tens of thousands.
    Unsurprisingly, it became natural to expect that it might stick around — into the future — for a similar length of time.
    So, the question was asked: can geological evidence tell us how long is left ahead for Earth?
  </p>
  <p>
    §
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometime in the 1720s, the French diplomat Benoît de Maillet handwrote a manuscript and circulated it amongst friends.
    He wrote it pseudonymously—pretending to be “an Indian philosopher”—to avoid censure for the radical claims therein.
    He didn’t camouflage himself too much, however.
    The manuscript’s title, <em>Telliamed</em>, is an anagram of de Maillet’s name.
    Fathoms ahead of his time, de Maillet predicted that the age of the Earth was a staggering “deux milliard d’annes”.
    That’s two billion years.
    He believed the Earth to have once been entirely covered in ocean and arrived at this eye-watering figure from measuring the steady diminution of the sea in various locales, before guesstimating how long it would have taken for the current amount of landmass to emerge.
    Based on his highly speculative model of how planets age, de Maillet’s theory gave another billion years ahead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, when <em>Telliamed</em> was posthumously published, its editor — an Abbé with an eye for orthodoxy — removed all references to actual numbers, replacing them with indeterminate phrases like “an immensity of time”.<sup>[22]</sup> In English translation, they were removed entirely.<sup>[23]</sup>
    As such, though bewilderingly prescient, de Maillet’s contribution was lost.
  </p>

  <h2>2.2—Revolution (1800-1830)</h2>
  <p>
    The end of the 1700s and opening of the 1800s was an age of revolutions.
    Ruptures in the political world — where the unprecedented replaces what came before it — were echoed by growing evidence that similarly dramatic upheavals punctuated prehistoric time.
    As Romantic writers renovated poetry, palaeontologists — unearthing extinct beasts — were reorganising ideas about time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not only did it appear to palaeontologists that humans represent a late addition to a vastly elder Earth, but it also appeared this prehuman tract was filled — not with stasis — but with turmoil and drama.
    Digging deeper and deeper into the Earth, palaeontologists noticed the skeletons change drastically — becoming progressively less familiar at deeper depths.
    Based on the fossils, the world appeared to have passed through, first, an “Age of Fish”, then an “Age of Reptiles”, before, finally, our current “Age of Mammals”.
  </p>
  <p>
    In response, romantics and revolutionaries began asking: if so much change had unfolded in the past, who’s to say that there isn’t scope for similarly unprecedented alteration in the lengthening future too?
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1831, Honoré de Balzac compared the leading palaeontologist of the day — Georges Cuvier — to Lord Byron.
    Balzac provoked: “Is not Cuvier the greatest poet of our century?”
    The naturalist, he explained, has “reconstructed worlds from whitened bone”, and shone light into the “fathomless abyss of the past”.
    “Cuvier is a poet by mere numbers”, Balzac concluded.
    His findings imply an Earthly biography measured in the “thousand millions of years”.<sup>[28]</sup>
    Given that time’s ambits were bursting, and consensus was far from reach, there were bound to be some who, in this vastness, instead saw evidence of infinity.
    Eternity recurred.
  </p>

  <h2>2.3—Thermidor (1830-1850)</h2>
  <p>
    We have a tendency to perceive infinity in any interval or distance that is larger than the largest span we were previously familiar with.
    But the fact we find some magnitude difficult to circumscribe in our minds is no evidence that, in reality, it lacks circumference and limit.
    Nonetheless, it can be easy to miss this.
    After all, because it lacks proportion, eternity is, in some ways, an easier thing to conceive than a count or collection of a trillion moments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, when people have encountered something whose limits they cannot directly see or easily grasp, they have tended to assume it simply lacks limits.
    The same applied to chronology, beyond tangible scales.
  </p>
  <p>
    §
  </p>
  <p>
    Toward the close of the 1700s, the Scottish geologist James Hutton reasoned that we should, in explaining geological effects, only conscript causes that are currently observable.
    Following this rule, and rallying everyday causes (like erosion or sedimentation, which work at piecemeal pace), it becomes evident unthinkable aeons are required to explain Earth’s vast mountains and dramatic canyons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hutton’s methodology — focusing exclusively on currently observable factors — worked as a way of excising supernatural or unverifiable explanations from the science of geology, but it also came to be overapplied.
    He came to believe the Earth system had never looked dramatically different from how it looks today, and that unprecedented systemic change, in the future, was also impossible.
    From this, he surmised that, considered properly, the Earth’s established age and future lifespan may be — literally — measureless.
    Hutton’s mantra is famous: “We find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end”.<sup>[29]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    This was because Hutton, a deeply religious man, believed there is “wisdom, system, consistency” everywhere in nature.
    Accordingly, to him, a living world that unceasingly renews itself and never truly changes — nor ages — is more rational than one that is born and dies.
    This led him to suspect that the world had ever fully been “sterile”, doubting there had ever been a time when it housed neither “neither plant nor animal”.<sup>[30]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hutton’s voluminous writings were elegantly summarised and communicated by his protégé, Charles Lyell, in the 1830s.
    Lyell, following Hutton, assumed the Earth was a steady state system, wherein nothing is truly lost nor ever truly gained.
    His sense of the boundlessness of Earth’s lifespan led him to surmise that, in some distant future, dinosaurs would — somehow — return to stomp the English countryside.
    In eternity, after all, everything recurs and nothing is truly new.<sup>[31]</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    Nonetheless, Buffon’s view — that the Earth’s biography has determinate, and measurable, bookends in time — eventually won the day.<sup>[32]</sup>
    Evidence accumulated, eventually becoming undeniable, for vestiges of a beginning and prospects of an end.
    But, beyond this, in the immensities of outer space, it was hard to say whether everything currently happening here and now would endlessly repeat, without beginning nor end.
    Prior to Darwinism, scientists did not agree that other planets would certainly not house identical species to those we find on Earth.
    Accordingly, even though the planet had gained biographical bookends, it was still an open question as to whether the species upon it were truly mortal or immortal.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cosmos itself was, at this time, considered unlimited in space and time.
    Again, in eternity and infinity, everything possible happens, and everything lost returns, without limit or cessation.
    “Let us add that since nothing is annihilated in nature”, de Sales had reassured: the time of our individual planet’s “ruin will only be that of its renewal”.<sup>[33]</sup>
    For his own part, Fourier had assumed our “souls” would somehow be transmigrated to other habitable “globes”, ensuring our resurrection throughout “eternity”.<sup>[34]</sup>
  </p>

  <h2>3—Thermodynamics</h2>
  <p>
    Developed during the 1800s, thermodynamics is the mathematics of heat, enabling measurement of its sources and modelling of its flows.
    By the middle of the century, scientists accepted that — as all life ultimately is fuelled by the sun — we should look to our sun’s age to gauge how long life has been around and how long it might persist on Earth.
    Long before knowledge of atomic energy, scientists assumed the sun produces heat by a mechanical frictional process.
    Given this, it is presumed our sun is much nearer its senility than youth.
    Consensus forms around a prediction of several million years left ahead.
    But this proved depressing as it was believed evolution’s past was four or five times longer than its oncoming prospect.
    It had taken life to get this far, but — comparatively — it seemed there wasn’t time ahead to explore further possibilities.
    ‘Now’ remained nearer the conclusion than the dawn.
  </p>

  <h2>3.1—Industrial (1830-1870)</h2>
  <p>
    Eternity still held sway in the sidereal immensities and outer nebulae, then being pried at by the first large reflecting telescopes.
    But how much longer did life have left, here, within our Solar System?
    What further development might be possible?
    Answering this question involved estimating how long it had taken for life to arrive at its current grandeur and diversity on Earth, so as to gauge how much further development could be cumulated in the time left ahead.
    And answering this required looking to the furnaces fuelling the snowballing Industrial Revolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dynamo driving industrialisation, dredging wealth out of the Earth, was coal burning.
    Without coincidence, it was at this time — through the early 1800s — that the science of heat was developed.
    By 1854, the Scottish scientist William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) gave it its name: thermodynamics.
  </p>
  <p>
    This provided far better tools, for gauging the placement of ‘now’, than the rudimentary ones available to Buffon less than a handful of generations before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thermodynamics is the mathematics of energy, enabling measuring of sources of heat and the modelling of its flows.
    It proved all work and activity expends energy, and, because spent energy cannot be recouped, all activity depends on the disbursing of some expendable fund.
    Thermodynamics, for the first time, threw into crisp relief the truth that almost all activity on Earth is ultimately fuelled by one wellspring: the sun.
    Even coal, after all, is fossilised sunshine.
  </p>
  <p>
    As John Tyndall wrote in 1863: 
  </p>
  <p>
    “Every tree, plant, and flower grows and flourishes by the grace and bounty of the sun. […] There is not a hammer raised, a wheel turned, or a shuttle thrown, that is not raised, and turned, and thrown by the sun. […] Look at the integrated energies of the world — the stored power of our coal-fields; our winds and rivers; our fleets, armies, and guns. What are they? They are all generated by a portion of the sun’s energy.”<sup>[35]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Scientists now saw clearly that — as all life on Earth is ultimately fuelled by our star — we should look to the sun’s lifespan to gauge how long life has been around and how long it might yet persist on our planet.
    Buffon had assumed we relied primarily on an internal fund of heat within Earth; now it was understood that the length of life’s past and future depends on the sun’s birth and death.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, another upshot of thermodynamics was the firm conclusion our sun must one day itself die.
    If spent energy cannot be recouped, solar luxuriance must one distant day bankrupt itself.
    Suns don’t flicker on and off in an eternal cycle, as was previously thought plausible.
    They all eventually die.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, physicists began asking: how long has our sun been outpouring heat, and how much longer can it continue to wring out energy for our sustenance?
  </p>

  <h2>3.1—Decadence (1870-1900)</h2>
  <p>
    By 1861, Thomson revised his numbers upwards, but not by all too much.
    He now claimed Earth’s “inhabitants” cannot have “many million years longer”.<sup>[40]</sup>
    Ten years later, Helmholtz made his own attempt.
    He announced that our sun has been shining for 22,000,000 years, and we cannot expect it “to maintain an additional 17,000,000 of years the same intensity of sunshine as that which is now the source of all terrestrial life”.<sup>[41]</sup>
    By 1878, the Canadian-American astronomer Simon Newcomb chimed in, calculating that sometime before “12,000,000 years” hence, our star will “rapidly cease to radiate the heat necessary to support life on the globe”.<sup>[42]</sup>
    The US spectroscopist Charles Augustus Young, in 1881, echoed Newcomb’s conclusion: the sun will “continue to give sufficient heat to support life on earth” for “ten million years from the present time”.<sup>[43]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    §
  </p>
  <p>
    By the closing decades of the century, thermodynamic forecasts on Earth’s future varied, but they clustered around a prospect of around 10,000,000 further years.
    The scientific community had converged on a kind of consensus.
    The sun would die, killing Earth by cold, in several million years’ time.
    There was not yet consensus on the age of the Earth.
    Debate raged between physicists who preferred shorter timescales and biologists who, because of the time required for evolution by natural selection, preferred longer ones.
    Nonetheless, estimates ranged between Kelvin’s 20,000,000 and 100,000,000 years for the past.<sup>[44]</sup>
    It seemed humanity was, once more, living nearer the end than the beginning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some dismissed the prospect of the sun’s death entirely, calling it “repugnant to the moral sense and against all law”, claiming “old sol” will shine “forever”.<sup>[45]</sup>
    British newspapers quipped that it “may be news to know that the world will wind up in ten million years, but the news will become stale before that time”.<sup>[46]</sup>
    Others took it more seriously.
    Writers and illustrators produced lurid visions of the last human family, huddling together, about to be picked off by inexorably creeping cold.
    There was a mood of pessimism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forecasts of 10,000 further years were admittedly much more commodious than Buffon’s earlier estimates, not to mention those of earlier Christians.
    However, in the century since Buffon, the sense of life’s unexplored potentials had grown — largely thanks to Darwin’s theories.
  </p>
  <p>
    What’s more, the theory that the sun produces heat via collapsing on itself led physicists to conclude the ratio of ‘past spent’ to ‘future ahead’ was unforgiving.
    If it had started life as a diffuse cloud, our star — now relatively compact and dense — seemed at an advanced, geriatric stage of life’s arc.
    It was believed evolution’s past was four or five times longer than the time left ahead.
    Communicating this in a much-quoted passage from 1892, the Irish astronomer Robert S. Ball declared there is a “distinct limit to man’s existence on our earth”.
    Our sun, he announced, “has dissipated four-fifths of the energy with which it may have originally been endowed”.
    It may hold out for 4,000,000 years, or for 5,000,000, Ball professed, but not for 20,000,000.<sup>[47]</sup>
    He concluded:
  </p>
  <p>
    “The race is as mortal as the individual, and, so far as we know, its span cannot under any circumstances be run out beyond a number of millions of years which can certainly be told on the fingers of both hands, and probably on the fingers of one.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The placement of ‘now’ — relative to established past and potential future — had returned to a position similar to that of the early Christians.
  </p>
  <p>
    §
  </p>
  <p>
    In an 1893 lecture delivered in Oxford’s ornate Sheldonian theatre, the prominent naturalist Thomas Henry Huxley looked forward miserably to a protracted, senile death in the not-too-distant future.<sup>[48]</sup>
    Life is past its prime, Huxley pronounced.
    We can look to a future populated by increasingly simple lifeforms, withering on a diet of dwindling sunlight.
    One day, there will only be lichen and moss left.
    An attendee at Huxley’s lecture reacted to the depressing implications.
    He pointed to the many “million s of years” spent “bringing us up to the present point” of organic evolution, before bemoaning the fact “no sufficient time” appeared to remain ahead, within which “to evolve all the possibilities of our actual state”: 
  </p>
  <p>
    “This is sad indeed. Waste, sheer waste, on the most gigantic scale…”<sup>[49]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Huxley had decreed that not even the “most daring imagination” can find a way to “arrest” the coming of this end.<sup>[50]</sup>
    But, then, as the 1800s closed, and the 1900s opened, an entirely new force of nature was discovered, blowing the ceiling off all previous upper bounds on time past and future.

  <h2>4—Radium </h2>
  <p>
    In the opening years of the 1900s, following the discovery of radioactivity, Marie Curie proved atoms expel vast amounts of energy without taking any from their surroundings.
    This reveals that a shocking wealth of extra energy is locked up within mundane matter, hitherto previously unacknowledged.
    Immediately, scientists claim atomic energy might power the sun.
    Estimates for the future explode overnight.
    So too, does radioactivity provide a way to begin accurately dating the Earth:
    radiometric dating of rocks finally confirms our earth is not millions, but billions, of years old.
    In contrast, given new theories of solar heat, some scientists feel confident claiming it will remain habitable for a further trillion years…
    Suddenly, ‘now’ seemed far closer to the breaking dawn of time, rather than its decrepit end.
  </p>

  <h2>4.1—1900 &amp; 1910s</h2>
  <p>
    Uranium rays were first noticed, by fortuitous mistake, by Henri Becquerel in 1896.
    He noticed that, curiously, uranium crystals seem to be emitting energetic rays spontaneously, without any exchange with their surroundings.
    Not long after, Marie Skłodowska-Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie, decided to investigate this mysterious phenomenon.
  </p>
  <p>
    §
  </p>

  [Position 2]

  <p>
    Having coined the word “radio-activité”, Marie Curie successfully isolated radium in 1902.
    Not long after, she proved that the element expels energy without itself losing heat.
    Radioactive atoms, she showed, were tiny furnaces.
    In parallel, it was established this happened as the atoms themselves gradually disintegrated.
    Gradual it was: some elements, it was quickly revealed, decay over periods stretching into the multiple billions of years.
  </p>
  <p>
    The revelations of Curie almost immediately triggered a flurry of excited responses from scientists across fields ranging from geology to astronomy.
    By September of 1903, the geophysicist George Darwin (son of the biologist) celebrated Curie’s “unexpected” discovery of this “new source of energy”.
    If the sun powers itself by “liberating atomic energy”, he conjectured, rather than mere gravitational collapse, then we may have to expand the “cosmical time-scale” by “some such factor as ten or twenty”.<sup>[51]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Not long after, The Daily Mail reported jubilantly on the matter.
    “Lord Kelvin” (as William Thomson was now known), the reporter wrote, “in his most desponding moments, only assigned a beggarly five or six million years to the duration of the life-giving sun”.
    But here, they continued, comes “radium to the rescue”: lengthening our species’s “expectation of life by several hundred million years”.<sup>[52]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    By 1907, the physicist Ernest Rutherford concurred, writing that we can expect solar “brilliancy” for orders of magnitudes more than Kelvin’s considerations of no “more than 12 million years and probably much less”.
    Curie’s “new source of heat”, Rutherford wrote, probably suffices to power the “sun for a longer period”, thus vouchsafing a much greater “time for habitation of our globe”.<sup>[53]</sup>
    By 1920, prominent physicist Arthur Eddington was venturing that our sun, powered by subatomic reservoirs, would be able to “maintain its output of heat for 15 billion years” more.
    To hammer home his point, he referred to the gravitational theory of Kelvin and Helmholtz as a “corpse”.<sup>[54]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    From meagre millions, the expected future had ballooned into the multiple billions.
    In following years, as the twenties roared, timescales continued to become even longer.
    The English cosmologist Sir James Jeans, in 1928, produced even more eye-watering forecasts.
    Comparing atoms to “pure bottled energy”, he produced his own theory for how they uncork themselves in the sun:
    believing they collide, perfectly annihilating each other’s matter, converting their entire mass into pure energy.
    Albert Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence equation (E=mc²) dictated that the resulting energy would be mass multiplied by the speed of light (which is 299,792,458 metres per second),
    which meant that Jeans’s resulting calculations for the solar future proved mind-boggling.
    He boldly estimated that our star retains enough “unbroken bottles” for a “million million years” more sunlight.
    That is 1,000,000,000,000 years.<sup>[56]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    But what did this mean for people? Almost as soon as Curie’s revelations were unleashed on the world, people started proclaiming they were living far closer to the very beginning of the human story than its ending.
  </p>
  <p>
    Communicating the potential scale of the future in his 1929 bestseller <em>The Universe Around Us</em>, Jeans visualised a stamp atop a penny, balanced upon a 20m-high (66ft) obelisk.
    The stamp's thickness represented recorded history.
    The stamp and penny combined represented our species’s existence.
    The distance from the stamp down to the obelisk-base was the age of Earth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jeans didn't stop there.
    He calculated the height of postage stamps, stacked one atop the other, you'd need for a trillion further years of habitability on Earth.
    “A pile as high as Mont Blanc”, he concluded.
    Jeans deemed us “creatures of the dawn”, with “unimaginable opportunities for accomplishment” and “unexplored potentialities” ahead.<sup>[57]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Elsewhere, reporting updated knowledge from archaeology, Jeans relayed that humankind has “existed on earth for something like 300,000 years”, and civilisation has only existed for around 5,000 years.
    He continued:
    “Old Mother Earth must regard man as a very recent apparition indeed; he has just appeared. […] If he [has done] so much in the first few moments of his existence, she may well wonder what is in store for her in the long future ages in which he is destined to labour on her surface.
    For in all probability the life in front of the human race must enormously exceed the short life behind it.”<sup>[58]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    But that wasn’t all: not only did radium reveal a capacious future, it also lifted previous limits on evolution’s past by revealing new ways to date the Earth’s age.

  <h2>5—Cosmology</h2>
  <p>
    Through the 1920s and 1930s, Edwin Hubble noticed that other galaxies are receding from us.
    Extrapolating backwards, this implies the cosmos itself had a beginning; looking forwards, it implies it will have a rarefied end.
    Previously considered eternal, the universe itself was gaining bookends in time.
    Buoyed by revelations in nuclear physics, cosmologists began predicting how old the universe was and how long it might remain capable of hosting complex life beyond Earth.
    It becomes possible to pinpoint the placement of ‘now’, not just within the unfolding biography of our planet, but also of the wider cosmos.
    Happily, this also coincides with the first claims that nuclear-powered rockets might, one distant day, allow Earthly life to outlive our dying sun by migrating elsewhere.
    Consensus emerges that our cosmos is over ten billion years old, but will remain habitable for orders of magnitudes longer than this.
    Once again, and in a far more profound sense, we are revealed to be “creatures of the dawn”.
  </p>

  <h2>5.1—1920s &amp; 1930s</h2>
  <p>
    In the 1920s, astronomers like Edwin Hubble noticed that other galaxies are flinging away from us, and accelerating as they do.
    Extrapolating back, this implied the cosmos itself had a compact beginning; peering forward, it indicated that it will have a rarefied end, as matter centrifuges into nullity.
    Previously, the assumption was that — though planets and suns had bookended biographies, such that they are born, live shorter or longer, and die — the cosmos itself didn’t suffer such inconveniences.
    It was thought the universe itself lacked boundaries in space and time.
  </p>
  <p>
    But, though such claims initially remained highly contentious, astronomers now began speaking tentatively about a “universal evolutionary process”.<sup>[62]</sup>
    Some acknowledged that, if this expansion is true, the “observable” universe cannot be “unlimited” in time and space.<sup>[63]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    These developments were also inspired, in part, by Curie.
    In the 1930s, the French priest and physicist Georges Lemaître was the first to propose the universe began with a primordial explosion.
    He proposed that it began life as a “primeval atom” that explosively disintegrated, like a radioactive element, bursting into the receding galaxies we see today.
    Poetically, he wrote:
  </p>
  <p>
    “The evolution of the universe can be compared to a display of fireworks that has just ended: some few red wisps, ashes and smoke.
    Standing on a well-chilled cinder, we see the slow fading of the suns, [&] recall the vanished brilliance of the origin of worlds.”<sup>[64]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    By the 1920s, though they remained few and far between, some cosmologists began feeling confident enough to put tentative ages on the universe itself.
    In these early days, the numbers varied wildly: from Jeans’s 1929 estimate, based on the rate of matter’s radioactive decay, of an age of 200,000,000,000,000 years to Alexander Friedmann’s 1923 guess of 10,000,000,000 years.<sup>[65]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Another ingenious, albeit incorrect, method Jeans conjured to assess the age of the universe was looking at the velocities of stars, and calculating how long it would take for them to arrive at the current velocity distribution, assuming they interact—exerting gravitational drag on each other when passing by—like particles in a cloud of gas.
  </p>
  <p>
    For several years there was a debate over a “long time scale”, assuming a universe trillions of years old, and the “short time scale”, of billions.
    But, as evidence for and understanding of the cosmos’s expansion itself expanded, the latter eventually came to be accepted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, now that radioactivity had revealed new sources of energetic abundance, the fledgling field of nuclear physics presented a new promise for the possibility of humankind one day overcoming the penury of being locked to one planet.
    It became clear our species has not yet come anywhere close to tapping the ceiling on maximally harnessing available energy.
    This keyed directly into the first concrete hopes Earthly life may one day decouple its future from that of the sun.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1912, the French astronautics pioneer Robert Esnault-Pelterie arrived at the conclusion that atomic power makes spaceflight much more feasible.
    He calculated that “400 kg of radium”, propelling a “1,000 kg vehicle”, would be enough “for the journey to Venus and back”.<sup>[66]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    A year afterward, the American scientist Robert Goddard arrived at an even bolder conclusion.
    He wrote in notebooks that “navigation of interplanetary space must be effected to insure the continuance” of our species, and that there would be no “greater possible calamity” than allowing its “cessation”.<sup>[67]</sup>
    Accordingly, he asked:
  </p>
  <p>
    “[w]ill it be possible to travel to the planets which are around the fixed stars, when the sun and the earth have cooled to such an extent that life is no longer possible on the earth?”
  </p>
  <p>
    He reasoned that it will be, on the condition that it is “possible to unlock, and control, intra-atomic energy”.
    He even imagined the use of a “radium alarm clock” to wake up pilots intermittently throughout the unimaginably long flight.
    He proposed migration to areas in the galaxy where “stars are thickly clustered, so that further migration would be easy”.<sup>[68]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    With this, it became possible to speculate: if terrestrial life ever managed to liberate itself from gravity in such a way, then the future ahead for living things might not be coupled to that of a sun.
    In other words, it would instead be bounded above by the future lifespan of the wider cosmos itself.
    Thankfully, and given the rapid developments in cosmology, some scientists were now happy to put estimates on this ultimate upper bound.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps the first to do so was the British-Indian geneticist, communist, and iconoclast J.B.S. Haldane.
    In a visionary 1927 short story, he wrote that a “generation ago it seemed very plausible” that a cooling sun would make our Earth uninhabitable in “a few million years”, but now physics suggests “that it will last for at least a million million years”, or, in other words, a 1,000,000,000,000 years.
    Given this available time, Haldane reasoned it is not unreasonable to assume that, if it is at all possible, our descendants may one day invent the means to propel rockets to other stars.
    Thereafter, he provided what is likely the first quantitative estimate of how long the future of Earthly life might be, should it achieve interstellar exodus.
    He surmised our “galaxy has a probable life of at least eighty million million years”, a figure he would reiterate a few years later.
    He concluded his speculation, by adding, piquantly: “And there are other galaxies”.<sup>[69]</sup>

  <h2>6—Climatology </h2>
  <p>
    Throughout the Cold War, whilst predictions were wildly expanding on how long the universe itself might be capable of hosting life beyond Earth, the potential future for life on Earth was — ironically — being slashed downward.
    Better understanding of how the sun fuels itself, via nuclear fusion, reveals that it will expand — rather than shrink as it ages.
    The Earth will cook, not freeze, as it is engulfed by our swelling star.
    Estimates for a trillion years of terrestrial future shrunk to ten billion in the 1940s, and to 5 billion in the 1960s.
    Since then, improved understanding of climate change — revealing just how fragile planetary atmospheres can be — has revealed that our Earth will become uninhabitable long before the sun engulfs it.
    But, during this time, estimates for how long life beyond Earth might persist begin to become truly eye-watering…
    This way, taking a cosmic — rather than terrestrial — perspective, we are, indeed, still “creatures of the dawn” to an unimaginable degree.
  </p>

  <h2>6.1—1960s</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout the 1950s, even better understanding of solar evolution was attained, again revising down estimates for the future of our sun.
    In his 1963 rewrite of <em>Biography of the Earth</em>, Gamow changed his forecast to reflect this changing picture.
    He now wrote: “…our sun is about 5 billion years old [and] it still has another 5 billion years to live…”<sup>[74]</sup>
    But, around this time, a rebellion was fomenting against building evidence for a universe with a finite lifespan.
    Eternity recurred, once again.
    Throughout the middle decades of the 1900s, the English astronomer Fred Hoyle — along with collaborators Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold — argued evidence of expansion was not an indication of a cosmic beginning.
    They theorised the universe doesn’t age, and remains in a steady state over time, hypothesising the appearance of cosmic explosion is caused by new matter and energy spontaneously and continuously emerging in the cosmic gaps between galaxies.<sup>[75]</sup>
    This way, our cosmos could have been expanding forever.
    Yet another attempt to return to the type of existence imagined by Aristotle and Hutton: one where time has no bookends, such that everything repeats and, eventually, resurrects.
    There is, clearly, comfort in such a notion. It insulates from loss.
    In Hoyle’s universe, Earth will repeat.
    But again, it is only in a universe where time is bookended that consequences matter, losses gain bite, and unprecedented change is possible at the most systemic levels.
    With bookends, not everything that can happen will happen, such that events that lock in certain outcomes — over other possibilities — become consequential.
    Hoyle’s courageous attempt to bring eternity back into the universe, however, was largely toppled in 1964.
    In this year, two astronomers discovered the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.
    After cleaning pigeon droppings from the insides of their radio telescope in New Jersey, Arno Allen Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson realised their antenna had captured something strange.
    It was a faint reverberation coming at Earth from all angles.
    Rather than pigeons rustling, they’d accidentally recorded the omnipresent echo of our universe’s pyrotechnic birth.<sup>[76]</sup>
    This was overwhelming proof for what had come to be called the Big Bang Theory.
    Our universe, it came to be agreed, was a determinate age.
    Over coming decades, estimates on this age would expand from around 2,000,000,000 up to over 10,000,000,000.

  <h2>6.2—1970s</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout the 1960s, humanity sent its first probes to other bodies in the Solar System, making the field of inquiry Gamow once called “comparative planetology” a reality.<sup>[79]</sup>
    On December 14th, 1962, the US’s Mariner II probe streaked within 35,000 km of Venus.
    This was humankind’s first successful flyby of another planet, spurred by the simmering Space Race.
    Previous generations fell in love with Venus, on account of awareness that it has a thick, swirling atmosphere.
    Coated in highly reflective clouds, making the planet twinkle in our morning and evening skies, this meant Venus’s surface was impenetrable to traditional telescopes.
    Accordingly, it became a blank slate upon which wishful fantasies could be projected.
    It became Earth’s mirror image, assumed to be tropical and sweltering, teeming with exotic life.
    But the Mariner’s flyby burst this bubble.
    It revealed that our planetary neighbour is an inhospitable, heat-scorched hellscape.
    When, in 1967, the Soviet Union’s Venera IV Probe became the first mission to enter the Venusian atmosphere, and alight on its surface, this was further confirmed.
    Venus is hell.
    Not only is its surface hot enough to melt lead, it is also fearsomely pressurised.
  </p>
  <p>
    It didn’t take long for scientists to start arguing that our neighbouring planet was not always so hellish.
    In the Solar System’s early days, Venus may have been quite clement, oceanic, even habitable.
    But, then, something happened to trigger its terrible transformation.
    In 1969, Andrew P. Ingersoll proposed the “runaway greenhouse effect” as an explanation.<sup>[80]</sup>
    This describes a process whereby increases in temperature cause water to evaporate, causing heightened atmospheric heat retention, triggering temperatures to continue rising in a reinforcing loop.
  </p>
  <p>
    Revealing how Venus became a hellscape this way, and how planetary atmospheres can tip from one state to another with the right forcing, helped lend impetus to the growing field of climate science.
    Many began worrying whether human action — dumping greenhouse gas into the atmosphere via industry — might cause a similar runaway on Earth.<sup>[81]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Scientists rapidly began realising that, long before the expanding sun consumes Earth outright, its swelling will cause a runaway greenhouse effect on Earth, making it uninhabitable.
    This provided a newly truncated upper bound to Earth’s habitable future.
    Accordingly, estimates on the Earthly future were, once again, revised down.
    In 1973, the Estonian astronomer Ernst Öpik produced a model predicting this would happen within 1,000,000,000 years; the previous year, the planetary scientists Carl Sagan and George Mullen produced slightly more liberal forecasts, giving a terrestrial future somewhere in the range of 3,500,000,000 to 4,000,000,000 further years for life on Earth.<sup>[82]</sup>
  </p>

  <h2>6.3—1980s &amp; 1990s</h2>
  <p>
    The range of future for life on Earth may have been slashed drastically from the trillions of years that Jeans had once estimated.
    However, the news was not all bad, as cosmology had been making leaps and strides in the meantime.
    The field of “physical eschatology”, studying the far future of the cosmos at large, was, by the 1980s and 1990s, far more confident making claims on the upper limits for the future time within which our universe might be able to host complex life.
    In 1983, a team of scientists laid out various far-flung scenarios in an article in <em>The Scientific American</em>.
    They were bold enough to make claims about how the evolution of the universe might impinge on its ability to support life over the longest term.
    They predicted that baryonic matter, the type of matter we are all made of, might evaporate within 10^32 years.
    But, looking past this, they argued this might not prove entirely fatal.
    After the decay of protons, they argued, intelligent life might feed off black holes.
    But, at 10^100 years, even these black holes might evaporate.
    “Any constant rate of energy consumption by life forms”, they concluded, “will in due course become untenable”.<sup>[84]</sup>
    Publishing in the same year, the Bangladeshi cosmologist Jamal Nazrul Islam agreed with this hypothesis, forecasting proton decay in “approximately 10^45 -10^50 years”.<sup>[85]</sup>
    As the second millennium shaded into the third, in 1999, astrophysicists Fred Adams and Greg Laughlin published their pathbreaking <em>The Five Ages of the Universe</em>.
    This provided the first book-length treatment of the question of physical eschatology.
    Concurring with Islam, Adams and Laughlin put proton decay, and the end of complex life, at 10^40 years in the future.
    That’s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years away.
    Between then and now is — it’s fair to say — a very long way.
  </p>

  <h2>6.3—Our Precarious Present </h2>
  <p>
    Humans are orienting creatures.
    We orient ourselves in the world to better navigate our way through it.
    We seek to know how things work, to better manipulate them; we seek to know how things are, to better assess our priorities.
    Over the centuries, our species has oriented itself not just in space, but also in time.
    In seeking to answer the riddle ‘where is now?’, our species embarked on a journey taking us far from the familiar scale of a life, bookended by birth and death and meted out in decades.
    It took us beyond the traditional limits of human history, measured in generations, centuries, and the crumbling of empires.
    To fully answer the riddle of where we find ourselves in time, we had to seek our place relative to the evolution of all life, the unfolding chronicle of the planet, and even the aging of the entire universe—stretching from the Big Bang to its ultimate ends.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now know that the Earth is roughly 4.5 billion years old.
    Life began not long afterward.
    Ever since, evolution has been cumulating innovations and aptitudes, storing them in the script we call genes.
    There is grandeur in this view of life: in knowing that each one of us is the way we are, rather than any other way, because of chance encounters going back not only to our early childhoods and births but also to life’s very beginning.
    Every individual is a result of a memory bank billions of years in the making.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also now know our planet has been home to things you and I would recognise as “animals” — that is, multicellular and mobile forms of life — for just over half a billion years.
    This is the tract of time within which there have been eyes to witness and minds to model this aging world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today’s experts predict that Earth may remain habitable — that is, a place where complex life can go about doing complex and interesting things — for something on the order of a further billion years.
    Our species, by comparison, has only been around for a measly few hundred thousand years.
    So, compared to all that’s past, we have only just appeared.
    Relative to all that might yet come, the story of life that is like us may have only just begun.
  </p>
  <p>
    What’s more, we also now know that each one of us — in a very physical, very physiological way — is 13.8 billion years old.
    This is the age of the universe.
    It took the universe this long to forge the elements, and to build up the cumulative complexity that makes things like us possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    The heavier elements that make up our bodies are forged from the diastole of dying suns, which it took the entire cosmos generations of stars to achieve.
    It took the universe 13.8 billion years to create creatures capable of realising they are the result of a process this long-winding.
  </p>
  <p>
    What’s more, pinpointing the placement of ‘now’ relative to time’s ultimate bookends also falsified ancient assumptions that we have the luxury of eternal repeats:
    that there might, within this cosmos, be repeats of what’s currently happening on Earth.
    We now know we have one shot.
  </p>
  <p>
    There’s one final point.
    Previously, when cosmic time lacked proportions and appeared eternal, it was possible to assume certain things simply weren’t possible.
    In a universe without a beginning, everything that can happen, necessarily already has happened, given the time available is limitless.
    Accordingly, unprecedented change — at the largest, most systemic scales — is unthinkable.
    People used to use this reasoning to dismiss the possibility of interstellar travel and of life ever getting a foothold above the planetary scale.
    None other than Fred Hoyle, believing he was living in an eternal universe, made just such a claim.
    In 1964, he wrote of what he thought a “good” argument “against deep space travel”: 
  </p>
  <p>
    “If we could do it, so could somebody else. […] Lots of others would have arrived here before now. Why would they have left? The planet is valuable real estate.”<sup>[87]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    In an eternal universe, if biologisation at scales above the planetary were possible, it would have already happened.
    We would have been visited from without.
    But we now know we don’t live in an eternal universe.
    What’s more, we now know we live in a young one: one that is over ten billion years old, but will remain hospitable for trillions of years further.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the crucial point.
    It now is feasible to assume not everything that can happen has already happened.
    Unprecedented change, at the largest levels, is now conceivable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Might life be the spark that inflicts the change: tipping the cosmos from its currently seemingly inorganic state into something more biological? Something more cephalised?
    Would this necessarily be inherently good? I don’t know.
    Is it inevitable? Almost certainly not.
    But, and this is the crucial point, it is now at least plausible we are simply living during that epoch before which life spills beyond its planet, coming to reorganise matter and energy at much larger scales.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, we don’t see any evidence of this already happening.
    But we can now ask ourselves the question: are we simply the first living, thinking world to ask what living, thinking worlds might ultimately be capable of?
    To me, this is the lesson of our generations-long quest to unveil the placement of ‘now’ within time’s wider expanses.
